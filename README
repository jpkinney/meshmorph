Assumptions
1. The surface mesh has triangular faces.
2. The mesh file format is used.
3. Each face normal vector = (v2-v1)x(v3-v1) where vi is the vector location of vertex index vi, points outward, away from the mesh object.
4. The mesh is fully closed.
5. No duplicate vertices, i.e. two or more vertices with different indices and identical x,y,z values.
6. No other files in directory with '.mesh' anywhere in the filename.
7. Vertex and Face indices are numbered sequentially, i.e. the largest Vertex and Face index is equal to the number of vertices and faces in mesh.
